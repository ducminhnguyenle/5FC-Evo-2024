- Quality control of assigned reads with no signs of DNA or rRNA contamination: [Feature and Biotype assignment](./feature_biotype/).
- Library complexity and duplication rate QC: [Library complexity](./library_complex/).
- Variant depth and the missingness calculation across all samples and variants: [Post variant calling QC](./vcfQC/).
